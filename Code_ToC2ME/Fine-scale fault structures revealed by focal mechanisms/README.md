# Plot Waveform on Focal Mechanisms

## Description
This repository provides code to plot waveforms on focal mechanisms.

## How to Run
Here we give a simple example

Run `Focal_mechanism_with_waveform_20241117_skhash.py`. Using the content from the 'HASH_Workflow' folder, you can plot the waveforms and station locations on beachballs to verify the reliability of the focal mechanism solutions.
