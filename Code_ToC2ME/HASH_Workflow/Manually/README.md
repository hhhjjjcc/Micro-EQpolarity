### MATLAB Waveform Picking Steps Summary

1. **Run `polarity_picking.m`**
   - Open the script and run it to enter the main interface.

2. **Load Data**
   - Click the **Load data** button to load the required waveform data.

3. **Mark P-wave Arrival**
   - Click **Mark P arrival**, and a red line will appear in the interface.

4. **Adjust View**
   - Based on the red line position, input `t0` and `t1` to zoom in on the waveform near the red line.
   - Click **Set xlim** to set the x-axis range.

5. **Determine Waveform Polarity**
   - Observe the **vertical** plot (the top waveform plot) and determine if the waveform to the right of the red line dips downward:
     - If downward, click **Down**.
     - If upward, click **Up**.
     - Click **Next** to move to the next point.

6. **Complete Polarity Picking for All Stations**
   - For each station, determine the waveform polarity (`Up` or `Down`).
   - Once all stations are processed, click **Finish** to complete.

### Output Results
- Results are saved in the `./OUT` folder.

- You can use these output to run SKHASH. See ../Automatically_EQpolarity folder README.md.
