# Focal Mechanisms Analyses

## Description

This repository provides scripts to show the spatial distribution of high quality Focal mechanisms in ToC2ME.

### Mapping.py
Map visualization of high-quality focal mechanisms in ToC2ME from a top-down perspective.

### rose_figure_upgrade_with_dip.py
Statistical visualization of high-quality focal mechanism parameters in ToC2ME, displaying the distribution of strike, dip, and rake angles. 

### Strike_rake_mapping_with_mt_solution.py
Alternative visualization of ToC2ME focal mechanisms where oriented bars represent fault strike directions.
